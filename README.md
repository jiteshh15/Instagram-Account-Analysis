🚀 Instagram Activity Analysis for a Tech Influencer

🔎 What’s This About?

This project dives into Instagram data to figure out what’s working (and what’s not!) for a Tech Influencer. We’re looking at posts, reels, and videos to understand engagement and improve content strategy.

📊 Data Overview:

9 months of Instagram activity (Jan - Sept)
3 database tables tracking likes, comments, shares & more

🎯 What Are We Doing?

✅ Spotting trends in how followers interact with content 👥📊

✅ Comparing performance of posts, reels & videos 🖼️🎥

✅ Finding ways to boost engagement & reach more people 🚀

This project is part of my virtual internship at AtliQ Technologies, and I’m excited to turn data into insights that make a difference! Stay tuned for the findings. 😎📈
